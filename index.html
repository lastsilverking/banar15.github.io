    <marquee>NO MORE AR15's!</marquee>
    <p>The AR15 is one of the most used assault rifles in mass shootings in recent years. Where is the logic for a military style weapon like the AR15. No pistol can out shoot a gun like the AR15 because of it's fast shooting power. What is even more scary is bump stocks on them. Bump stocks are highly dangerous gun modifications that can turn a gun like an AR15 into a fully automatic super assault weapon.</p>
